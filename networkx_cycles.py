def recursive_simple_cycles(G,depth):
    """Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.

    A simple cycle, or elementary circuit, is a closed path where no
    node appears twice, except that the first and last node are the same.
    Two elementary circuits are distinct if they are not cyclic permutations
    of each other.

    This version uses a recursive algorithm to build a list of cycles.
    You should probably use the iterator version caled simple_cycles().
    Warning: This recursive version uses lots of RAM!

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
       A directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    A list of circuits, where each circuit is a list of nodes, with the first
    and last node being the same.

    Example:
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)])
    >>> nx.recursive_simple_cycles(G)
    [[0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2]]

    See Also
    --------
    cycle_basis (for undirected graphs)

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation follows pp. 79-80 in [1]_.

    The time complexity is O((n+e)(c+1)) for n nodes, e edges and c
    elementary circuits.
